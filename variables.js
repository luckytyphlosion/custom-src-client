If the segment ends on the title screen, quitting Minecraft is allowed, but the next segment must continue on the title screen.\r\n- For the entirety of the run, you are not allowed to open up another Minecraft world within the same installation directory as the world of the run. This includes during breaks. If you want to open up another world (e.g. for testing a strat), do so by creating a separate installation directory, or by using another computer.
